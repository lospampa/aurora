# Aurora
Aurora is an OpenMP framework that is completely transparent to both the designer and end-user. Without any code transformation or recompilation, it is capable of automatically finding, at run-time and with minimum overhead, the optimal number of threads for each parallel loop region and re-adapt in cases the behavior of a region changes during execution.

Aurora has been mainly developed by Arthur Francisco Lorenzon (aflorenzon@unipampa.edu.br) during his Ph.D. under supervision of Antonio Carlos Schneider Beck Filho (caco@inf.ufrgs.br)
